## Module Descriptions

### 1. Self-Tuning Engine
- Monitors workload and system metrics in real time.
- Automatically adjusts database parameters (e.g., buffer size, cache policy) for optimal performance.
- Logs tuning actions and their impact for future learning.

### 2. Predictive Query Optimizer
- Analyzes incoming queries and predicts optimal execution plans.
- Uses machine learning to adapt to changing workloads.
- Falls back to sequential scan or default plans if batch restrictions are detected.

### 3. Intelligent Indexing
- Recommends and creates indexes based on query patterns and table statistics.
- Handles index creation errors gracefully (e.g., unsupported column types).
- Continuously evaluates index effectiveness and prunes unused indexes.

### 4. Security & Compliance Module
- Monitors for anomalous access patterns and potential security threats.
- Logs all security events and detected anomalies.
- Ensures compliance with data access policies.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Each module is implemented as a separate Python package under `src/`.
- Communication between modules is managed via well-defined interfaces.
- Logs and metrics are stored in the `logs/` directory for auditing and analysis.
- The main automation script (`auto_run_all_tables.py`) orchestrates the workflow across all modules.

## Extensibility
- The architecture supports plug-and-play for new modules (e.g., advanced analytics, reporting).
- Configuration is managed centrally in `src/config.py`.
