```python
# Self-Tuning Engine Entry Point
```
- This is a comment indicating that this file serves as the entry point for the self-tuning engine module.

```python
from workload_monitor import WorkloadMonitor
from parameter_tuner import ParameterTuner
import time
```
- Imports the `WorkloadMonitor` class from the `workload_monitor.py` module in the same directory.
- Imports the `ParameterTuner` class from the `parameter_tuner.py` module in the same directory.
- Imports the built-in `time` module for time-related functions.

```python
def main():
```
- Defines the main function, which will serve as the starting point for the self-tuning process.

```python
    print("Starting Self-Tuning Engine...")
```
- Prints a message to indicate the self-tuning engine is starting.

```python
    monitor = WorkloadMonitor()
    tuner = ParameterTuner()
```
- Instantiates the `WorkloadMonitor` class to monitor database workload metrics.
- Instantiates the `ParameterTuner` class to tune database parameters based on metrics.

```python
    for _ in range(5):  # Simulate 5 monitoring cycles
```
- Loops five times to simulate five monitoring and tuning cycles.

```python
        metrics = monitor.get_metrics()
```
- Calls the `get_metrics()` method of `WorkloadMonitor` to retrieve current workload metrics.

```python
        print(f"[Metrics] {metrics}")
```
- Prints the retrieved metrics to the console.

```python
        new_params = tuner.tune(metrics)
```
- Calls the `tune()` method of `ParameterTuner`, passing the metrics, to get new tuned parameters.

```python
        print(f"[Tuned Parameters] {new_params}\n")
```
- Prints the tuned parameters to the console, followed by a newline for readability.

```python
        time.sleep(1)
```
- Pauses execution for 1 second before the next cycle, simulating a real monitoring interval.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
- Checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module).
- If so, calls the `main()` function to start the self-tuning engine.
